 <h1>The Best Movies According to Ebin</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
 <p>One of the best movie that is ever made. Too much of dark truths to handle. </p>
<h3>Blade Runner (1982)</h3>
<p>You will wonder how did they pull out this wonderful CG at that period of time. </p>
<h3>Lord of the Rings (Trilogy)</h3>
<p>There is no better movie in Adventure genre that can beat this marvel.</p>
